# CoWrite
Real-time collaborative editing app using CRDTs

To cut costs, we shut down the Spring Boot server. To test out CoWrite, clone and run it locally on IntelliJ to be able to login and access documents. However, node and react are hosted on render and vercel respectively to make real-time collaboration possible.
